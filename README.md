### Yabai
[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai "yabai") is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using ↗ [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd "skhd") and other third-party software.

### skhd
[skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd "skhd") is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS that focuses on responsiveness and performance. Hotkeys are defined in a text file through a simple DSL. skhd is able to hotload its config file, meaning that hotkeys can be edited and updated live while skhd is running.
